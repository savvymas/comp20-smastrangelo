<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p> In this assignment I assessed Ming's source code from Assignment 3 and looked for 
    security vulnerabilites.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>For the pen testing, the primary tool that I used was curl. I tested to see what
    parts of the site I could access and manipulate using curl.</p>

<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>

<p>I found multiple security vulnerabilites. For example, the data and information
    in the site is very vulnerable and easy to change and manipulate. Through 
    the same avenue that I manipulated the scores, I was able to insert other 
    bugs and even break the website. </p>

<h2>Issues Found<h2>

            not be rendered at all.

        <td>By using curl I was able to inject an infinite loop causing the site to
