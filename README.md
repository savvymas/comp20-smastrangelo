COMP 20 Fall 2018 Private Repo for Savannah Mastrangelo

What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

1. The purpose of this repository was to showcase all of the work and projects I produced in this class.

2. My favorite assignment was Assignment 3, because I felt that all of the things we learned came together. This assignment also 
made me feel much more capable as a web developer because everything started to click for me at the end. 

3. I think I have grown a lot from the beginning to the end of this course. Especially through the group project, I have started
to realize that I am now capable enough to design and implement a completely original project and use other APIs (such as
musicmatch and spotify). 

4. The most important thing I learned in this course is how extensive web development is. There are an infinite amount of things
to learn, which is why a large part of this course was doing things on your own. For example, the MBTA assignment taught me
how to navigate API documentation and use it for my own project. I am now using this same technique with my group project.

5. I would like deeper into styling. This is a nitpicky thing-- but I wish I had more time or knowledge on how to style things
better as it is not as simple as it seems.
